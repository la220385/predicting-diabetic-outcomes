**Predicting Diabetic Outcomes**

This project aims to uncover patterns and insights related to diabetes. By examining relationships
between various contributing factors—such as genetics, BMI, and other relevant features—we seek
to better understand the underlying causes of diabetes and the interactions among these variables.
