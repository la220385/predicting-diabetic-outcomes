# Model Selection and Evaluation in Predicting Diabetic Outcomes

## Project Overview
This README details my (Latifah J.'s) contributions to the "Predicting Diabetic Outcomes" project. My role was centered around the selection and evaluation of various supervised learning models to better predict diabetes outcomes using key features like BMI, Weight in Kilograms, and previous health conditions.

## Objectives
- Compare and evaluate the performance of different supervised learning models.
- Provide insights into model performance based on advanced visual analytics.

## Files
- `Diabetes_Outcomes_Modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the model training, comparison, and evaluation code.
- `Correlation Heatmap.png`: Visualization of feature correlations.
- `ROC Curve Comparison.png`: ROC curve analysis of model performance.
